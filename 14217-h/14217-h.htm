    <h2>CABITAL!</h2>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;The proposal to extend the Cab Radius to five
    miles from Charing Cross is good in its way, but it does not go
    far enough. My idea is that the cheap cab-fare should include
    any place in the Home Counties. Cabmen should also be prevented
    by law from refusing to take a person, say, from Piccadilly to
    St. Albans, on the plea that their horse "could not do the
    distance." All assertions of that kind should be punished as
    perjury. Cabmen are notoriously untruthful. Why should not Cab
    Proprietors, too, be obliged to keep relays of horses at
    convenient spots on all the main roads out of Town in case a
    horse really proves unequal to going fifteen miles or so into
    the country, in addition to a hard day's work in
    London?&mdash;Yours unselfishly,</p>

    <p class="author"><i>St. Albans</i>. NORTHWARD HO!</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;Why <i>will</i> people libel the Suburbs, and
    keep on describing them as dull? I am sure that a place which,
    like the one I write from, contains a Lawn Tennis Club
    (entrance into which we keep <i>very</i> select), a Circulating
    Library, where all the new books of two years' back are
    obtainable without much delay, a couple of handsome and ascetic
    young Curates, and a public Park, capable of holding twenty-six
    perambulators and as many nursemaids at one and the same time,
    can only fitly be described as an Elysium. Still, we
    <i>should</i> be grateful for better facilities for getting
    away from its delights now and then, and this proposal to
    extend the Cab Radius has the warmest support of Yours,</p>

    <p class="author">EASILY SATISFIED.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;By all means let us have cheaper Cabs in Greater
    London! The County Council should subsidise a lot of Cabs, to
    ply exclusively between London and the outskirts. Or why not a
    Government Cab Purchase Bill, like the Irish Land Purchase one?
    We want a special Minister for Public Locomotion&mdash;perhaps
    Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL would accept the post?</p>

    <p class="author">Yours, spiritedly, HAMPSTEAD HEATHEN.</p>

        Students <i>carousing.</i> Emissary of the Emperor
        <i>seated at table apart watching them. Apprehensive</i>
        Waiters <i>nervously supplying the wants of their
        Customers.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>First German Student</i>. Another flagon of beer,
    Kellner!</p>

    <p><i>Waiter</i>. Here, Mein Herr! (<i>Brings glass and, as he
    places it on the table, whispers aside.</i>) Oh, beware, my
    good Lord&mdash;this is your second glass.</p>

    <p><i>First Ger. Stu.</i> (<i>with a laugh</i>). I know what I
    am about! And now, my friends, I give you a toast&mdash;The
    Liberty of the Fatherland!</p>

    <p><i>Chorus of Students</i>. The Liberty of the Fatherland!
    [<i>They all drink.</i></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He makes an entry in his note-book.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>First Ger. Stu.</i> And now fill another glass. Fill, my
    comrades&mdash;I pray you, fill! Kellner! glasses
    round&mdash;for myself and friends.</p>

    <p><i>Kellner</i> (<i>as before&mdash;supplying their wants and
    warning them</i>). Oh, my gracious Lord, be careful! Your third
    glass&mdash;mind now, your third glass; you know the risk you
    are running! But one false drop and you are lost!</p>

    <p><i>First Ger. Stu.</i> (<i>as before</i>). Well, my good
    friend, be sure you supply us with no drop that is not good!
    Ha, ha, ha! Eh, KARL! eh, CONRAD! eh, HANS! Did you hear my
    merry jest?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>They all laugh.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Em. of the Emp.</i> (<i>as before</i>). Ha! (<i>making an
    entry in his note-book</i>). And they laugh at a witless joke!
    Good! Very good!</p>

    <p><i>First Ger. Stu.</i> (<i>joyously</i>). And now, my
    comrades, yet another toast&mdash;The Prosperity of the
    People!</p>

    <p><i>Chorus of Ger. Stu.</i> (<i>raising their glasses</i>).
    The People!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>They all drink.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Em. of the Emp.</i> (<i>apart</i>) Ha!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He makes an entry in his note-book.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>First Ger. Stu</i>. And now, a final flagon! Kellner!</p>

    <p><i>Kellner</i> (<i>as before</i>). Oh, high-born customer,
    beware! This is your fourth glass! You know the law!</p>

    <p><i>First Ger. Stu.</i> (<i>as before</i>). That indeed I do!
    And I also know that my daily allowance is&mdash;or rather
    was&mdash;twelve quarts <i>per diem</i>! And now, comrades, our
    last toast&mdash;The Freedom of the Press!</p>

    <p><i>Chorus of Ger. Stu.</i> (<i>raising their glasses</i>).
    The Freedom of the Press!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>They all drink.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Em. of the Emp.</i> (<i>apart</i>). This is too much!
    (<i>He rises, and approaches the Students</i>.) Your pardon,
    Gentlemen! But do you really believe in the toasts you have
    just drunk?</p>

    <p><i>Chorus of Stu.</i> Why, certainly!</p>

    <p><i>Em. of the Emp.</i> What, in the Liberty of the
    Fatherland?</p>

    <p><i>Chorus of Stu.</i> To be sure&mdash;why not?</p>

    <p><i>Em. of the Emp.</i> And the Prosperity of the
    People&mdash;mind you, only the People?</p>

    <p><i>Chorus of Stu.</i> Exactly&mdash;don't you?</p>

    <p><i>Em. of the Emp.</i> And further. You wish well to the
    Freedom of the Press?</p>

    <p><i>Chorus of Stu.</i> That was our toast! What next?</p>

    <p><i>Em. of the Emp.</i> (<i>producing staff of
    authority</i>). That, in the name of His Majesty, I arrest
    you!</p>

    <p><i>Chorus of Stu.</i> (<i>astounded</i>). Arrest us!
    Why?</p>

    <p><i>Em. of the Emp.</i> Because, if you believe in the
    Liberty of the Fatherland, ask for the Prosperity of the
    People, and admire the Freedom of the Press, you must be
    drunk!&mdash;very drunk! In virtue of the new law (which
    punishes the crime of intoxication), away with them!</p>

    <h2>THE CROSS-EXAMINER'S VADE MECUM.</h2>

    <p><i>Question</i>. Have you a right to ask any question in
    Court?</p>

    <p><i>Answer</i>. Certainly, and the questioning is left to my
    discretion.</p>

    <p><i>Ques.</i> What do you understand by discretion?</p>

    <p><i>Ans.</i> An unknown quality defined occasionally by the
    Press and the Public.</p>

    <p><i>Ques.</i> Is the definition invariably the same?</p>

    <p><i>Ans.</i> No, for it depends upon the exigencies of the
    Press and the frivolity and fickleness of the Public.</p>

    <p><i>Ques.</i> Were you to refrain from questioning a Witness
    anent his antecedents, and subsequently those antecedents
    becoming known, his evidence were to lose the credence of the
    papers, what would be said of you?</p>

    <p><i>Ans.</i> That I had neglected my duty.</p>

    <p><i>Ques.</i> Were you to question a Witness on his past,
    and, by an interruption of the trial, that Witness's evidence
    were consequently to become superfluous, what would then be
    said of you?</p>

    <p><i>Ans.</i> That I had exceeded my duty.</p>

    <p><i>Ques.</i> Is it an easy matter to reconcile the interests
    of your clients with the requirements of Public Opinion.</p>

    <p><i>Ans.</i> It is a most difficult arrangement, the more
    especially as Public Opinion is usually composed of the joint
    ideas of hundreds of people who know as much about law as does
    a bed-post.</p>

    <p><i>Ques.</i> In the eyes of Public Opinion, whose
    commendation is the most questionable?</p>

    <p><i>Ans.</i> The commendation of a Judge, because it stands
    to reason (according to popular ideas) that a man who knows his
    subject thoroughly must be unable to come to any definite
    decision as to its merits.</p>

    <p><i>Ques.</i> And in the eyes of the same authority, whose
    commendation is the most valuable?</p>

    <p><i>Ans.</i> In the eyes of Public Opinion the most valuable
    commendation would come from a man who is absolutely ignorant
    of everything connected with a Counsel's practice, but who can
    amply supply this possible deficiency by writing a letter to
    the papers and signing himself "FAIR PLAY."</p>

    <p><i>Ques.</i> Is there any remedy for setting right any
    misconception that may have occurred as to the rights and
    wrongs of cross-examiners?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>The Lower Hall of the Scuola di San
        Rocco, Venice. British Tourists discovered studying the
        Tintorets on the walk and ceiling by the aid of</i> RUSKIN,
        HARE, <i>and</i> BÆDEKER, <i>from which they read aloud,
        instructively, to one another.</i> Miss PRENDERGAST <i>has
        brought "The Stones of Venice" for the benefit of her
        brother and</i> PODBURY. <i>Long self-repression has
        reduced</i> PODBURY <i>to that unpleasantly hysterical
        condition known as "a fit of the giggles," which, however,
        has hitherto escaped detection.</i></p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>standing opposite "The Flight into Egypt"
    reading</i>). "One of the principal figures here is the
    Donkey." Where <i>is</i> Mr. PODBURY? (<i>To</i> P., <i>who
    reappears, humbly proffering a tin focussing-case.</i>) Thanks,
    but you need not have troubled! "The Donkey ...
    um&mdash;um&mdash;never seen&mdash;um&mdash;um&mdash;any of the
    nobler animals so sublime as this quiet head of the domestic
    ass"&mdash;(<i>here</i> BOB <i>digs</i> PODBURY <i>in the ribs,
    behind Miss P.'s back</i>)&mdash;"chiefly owing to the grand
    motion in the nostril, and writhing in the ears." (<i>A
    spasmodic choke from</i> PODBURY.) May I ask what you find so
    amusing?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>crimson</i>). I&mdash;I <i>beg</i> your
    pardon&mdash;I don't know <i>what</i> I was laughing at
    exactly. (<i>Aside to</i> BOB.) <i>Will</i> you shut up,
    confound you!</p>

    <p><i>A Stout Lady, close by</i> (<i>reading from</i> HARE).
    "The whole symmetry of it depending on a narrow line of light."
    (<i>Dubiously, to her Daughter</i>.) I don't
    <i>quite</i>&mdash;oh yes, I do now&mdash;that's it&mdash;where
    my sunshade is&mdash;"the edge of a carpenter's square, which
    connects those unused tools" ... h'm&mdash;can <i>you</i> make
    out the "unused tools," ETHEL? <i>I</i> can't.... But he
    says&mdash;"The Ruined House is the Jewish Dispensation." Now I
    should never have found <i>that</i> out for myself. (<i>They
    pass to another canvas.</i>) "TINTORET denies himself all aid
    from the features.... No time allowed for watching the
    expression" ... (That reminds me&mdash;what <i>is</i> the time
    by your bracelet, darling?) "No blood, no stabbing, or cutting
    ... but an awful substitute for these in the chiaroscuro." (Ah,
    yes, indeed! Do you see it, love?&mdash;in the right-hand
    corner?) "So that our
    eyes"&mdash;(<i>comfortably</i>)&mdash;"seem to become
    bloodshot, and strained with strange horror, and deadly
    vision." (Not one o'clock, <i>really</i>?&mdash;and we've to
    meet Papa outside Florian's, for lunch at one-thirty! Dear me,
    we mustn't stay too long over this room.)</p>

    <p><i>A Solemn Gentleman</i> (<i>with a troublesome cough, who
    is also provided with</i> HARE, <i>reading aloud to his
    wife</i>).... "Further enhanced
    by&mdash;rook&mdash;rook&mdash;rook!&mdash;a
    largely-made&mdash;rook&mdash;ook!&mdash;farm-servant, leaning
    on
    a&mdash;ork&mdash;ork&mdash;ork&mdash;ork&mdash;or&mdash;ook!&mdash;basket."
    Shall I&mdash;ork!&mdash;go on?</p>

    <p><i>His Wife</i>. Yes, dear, do, <i>please</i>! It makes one
    notice things so <i>much</i> more!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The</i> Solemn Gentleman <i>goes on.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>as they reach the staircase</i>). Now
    just look at this Titian, Mr. PODBURY! RUSKIN particularly
    mentions it. Do note the mean and petty folds of the drapery,
    and compare them with those in the TINTORETS in there.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>obediently</i>). Yes, I
    will,&mdash;a&mdash;did you mean <i>now</i>&mdash;and will it
    take me long, because&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[Miss PRENDERGAST <i>sweeps on scornfully.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>following, with a desperate effort to be
    intelligent</i>). They don't seem to have any Fiammingoes
    here.</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>freezingly, over her shoulder</i>). Any
    <i>what</i>, Mr. PODBURY? Flamingoes?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>confidently, having noted down the name at
    the Accademia on his shirt-cuff</i>). No, "Ignoto Fiammingo,"
    don't you know. I like that chap's style&mdash;what I call
    thoroughly Venetian.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Well-informed persons in front overhear and
        smile.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). That is rather
    strange&mdash;because "Ignoto Fiammingo" happens to be merely
    the Italian for "an unknown Fleming," Mr. PODBURY. [<i>Collapse
    of</i> PODBURY.</p>

    <p><i>Bob</i>. (<i>aside to</i> PODBURY). You great owl, you
    came a cropper <i>that</i> time! [<i>He and</i> PODBURY
    <i>indulge in a subdued bear-fight up the stairs, after which
    they enter the Upper Hall in a state of preternatural
    solemnity.</i></p>

    <p><i>The Solemn G.</i> Now what <i>I</i> want to see, my dear,
    is the ork&mdash;ork&mdash;angel that RUSKIN thinks TINTORETTO
    painted the day after he saw a
    rook&mdash;kic&mdash;kic&mdash;kic&mdash;kingfisher.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[BOB <i>nudges</i> PODBURY, <i>who resists temptation
        heroically.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>reading</i>).... "the fig-tree which, by
    a curious caprice, has golden ribs to all its leaves."&mdash;Do
    you see the ribs, Mr. PODBURY.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>feebly</i>). Y&mdash;yes. I <i>believe</i>
    I do. Think they grew that sort of fig-tree formerly, or is
    it&mdash;a&mdash;<i>allegorical</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>receiving this query in crushing
    silence</i>). The ceiling requires careful study. Look at that
    oblong panel in the centre&mdash;with the fiery serpents, which
    RUSKIN finely compares to "winged lampreys." You're not looking
    in the right way to see them, Mr. PODBURY!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>faintly</i>). I&mdash;I did see
    them&mdash;<i>all</i> of them, on my honour I did! But it gives
    me such a crick in my neck!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> Surely TINTORET is worth a crick in the neck.
    Did you observe "the intense delight in biting expressed in
    their eyes?"</p>

    <p><i>Bob.</i> (<i>frivolously</i>). <i>I</i> did,
    'PATIA&mdash;exactly the same look I observed last night, in a
    mosquito's eye.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[PODBURY <i>has to use his handkerchief
        violently.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The Stout Lady</i>. Now, ETHEL, we can just spend ten
    minutes on the ceiling&mdash;and then we <i>must</i> go. That's
    evidently JONAH in the small oval. (<i>Referring to plan</i>.)
    Yes, I thought so,&mdash;it <i>is</i> JONAH. RUSKIN considers
    "the whale's tongue much too large, unless it is a kind of
    crimson cushion for JONAH to kneel upon." Well, why
    <i>not</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Ethel</i>. A cushion, Mother? what, <i>inside</i> the
    whale!</p>

    <p><i>The Stout Lady</i>. That we are not <i>told</i>, my
    love&mdash;"The submissiveness of Jonah is well given"&mdash;So
    true&mdash;but Papa can't bear being kept waiting for his
    lunch&mdash;we really ought to go now. [<i>They go.</i></p>

    <p><i>The Solemn G.</i> (<i>reading</i>). "There comes up out
    of the mist a dark hand." Have <i>you</i> got the dark hand
    yet, my dear?</p>

    <p><i>His Wife</i>. No, dear, only the mist. At least, there's
    something that <i>may</i> be a branch; or a <i>bird</i> of some
    sort.</p>

    <p><i>The S.G.</i> Ha, it's full of suggestion&mdash;full of
    suggestion!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He passes on, coughing.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>to</i> PODBURY, <i>who is still
    quivering</i>). Now notice the end one&mdash;"the Fall of
    Manna"&mdash;not <i>that</i> end; that's "the Fall of
    <i>Man</i>." RUSKIN points out (<i>reading</i>)&mdash;"A very
    sweet incident. Four or five sheep, instead of pasturing, turn
    their heads to catch the manna as it comes down" (<i>here</i>
    BOB <i>catches</i> PODBURY's <i>eye</i>) "or seem to be licking
    it off each other's fleeces." (PODBURY <i>is suddenly convulsed
    by inexplicable and untimely mirth.</i>) Really, Mr. PODBURY,
    this is <i>too</i> disgraceful! [<i>She shuts the book sharply
    and walks away.</i></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Outside; by the landing-steps.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> BOB, go on and get the gondola ready. I wish
    to speak to Mr. PODBURY. (<i>To</i> PODBURY, <i>after</i> BOB
    <i>has withdrawn.</i>) Mr. PODBURY, I cannot tell you how
    disgusted and disappointed I feel at your senseless
    irreverence.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>penitently</i>). I&mdash;I'm really most
    awfully sorry&mdash;but it came over me suddenly, and I simply
    couldn't help myself!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> That is what makes it so very
    hopeless&mdash;after all the pains I have taken with you! I
    have been beginning to fear for some time that you are
    incorrigible&mdash;and to-day is really the <i>last</i> straw!
    So it is kinder to let you know at once that you have been
    tried and found wanting. I have no alternative but to release
    you finally from your vows&mdash;I cannot allow you to remain
    my suitor any longer.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>humbly</i>). I was always afraid I
    shouldn't last the course, don't you know. I did my
    best&mdash;but it wasn't <i>in</i> me, I suppose. It was
    awfully good of you to put up with me so long. And, I say, you
    won't mind our being friends still, will you now?</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> Of course not. I shall always wish you well,
    Mr. PODBURY&mdash;only I won't trouble you to accompany me to
    any more galleries!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> A&mdash;thanks. I&mdash;I mean, I know I should
    only be in your way and all that. And&mdash;I'd better say
    good-bye, Miss PRENDERGAST. You won't want me in the gondola
    just now, I'm sure. I can easily get another.</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> Well&mdash;good-bye then, Mr. PODBURY. I will
    explain to BOB.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>to himself, as the gondola disappears</i>).
    So <i>that's</i> over! Hanged if I don't think I'm sorry, after
    all. It will be beastly lonely without anybody to bully me, and
    she could be awfully nice when she chose.... Still it <i>is</i>
    a relief to have got rid of old TINTORET, and not to have to
    bother about BELLINI and CIMA and that lot.... How that beggar

    <p>From numerous sources of information, we learn that prime
    English beef is underdone, which causes rather a run on mutton.
    <i>Revenons</i>, &amp;c., is the watchword in many households.
    Poultry flies rather high for the time of year, and grouse is
    also up. Grice&mdash;why not? plural of mouse,
    mice&mdash;grice, we say, are growing more absent, and
    therefore dearer. Black game is not so darkly hued as it is
    painted, and a few transactions in wild duck are reported. Lard
    is hardening, as usual in frosty weather. Hares are not so mad
    as in March, still, on the approach of a passer-by, they go off
    rapidly. Rabbits, especially Welsh ones, are now excellent. As
    Christmas recedes, geese have stopped laying golden eggs.
    Turkey (in Europe, at least) is in high feather. Brill is now
    in brilliant condition; soles are right down to the ground,
    whilst eels begin to show themselves in pairs. Halibut is
    cheap, but sackbut is scarce, and psaltery requires such
    prolonged soaking before it is fit for the table, that
    purchasers fight shy of anything but small parcels. As for
    plaice, a large dealer tells us he has been driven to the
    conclusion that there is "no plaice like home."</p>

    <p>We hear of a curious incident in connection with the revival
    of <i>Henry the Eighth</i> at the Lyceum. On Saturday night, a
    gentleman who had witnessed the play from the Stalls and
    carefully sat it out, demanded his money back as he went out.
    He did so on the ground that he had always understood that
    <i>Henry the Eighth</i> was by SHAKSPEARE, and found it
    credibly asserted that that gentleman had no part in the
    authorship of the piece. Mr. BRAM STOKER, M.A., was called to
    the assistance of the box-keeper, and ably discussed the point.
    Whilst declining to commit himself to the admission that
    SHAKSPEARE had no hand in the work, he quoted authority which
    assigned the authorship to FLETCHER and MASSENGER; in which
    case, he ingeniously argued, the authorship being dual, the
    price of the Stalls ought to be doubled. Conversation taking
    this turn, the gentleman, whose name did not transpire,
    withdrew.</p>

    <p>Miss JANE COBDEN, ex-Alderman of the London County Council,
    who has long pluckily championed Woman's Rights, has now,

    <p>A telegram from Berlin states that Dr. PFEIFFER, a
    son-in-law of Professor KOCH, has succeeded in discovering the
    cause of influenza and its infection in a bacillus, which, when
    seen under the microscope, appears in the shape of a most
    minute rod. The best thing that can be done with this rod is to
    put it in pickle, and keep it there.</p>

    <p>It is satisfactory to know that, at the approaching revival
    of <i>Hubando, the Brigand</i>, the handkerchiefs used by the
    Brigands in their famous scene of contrition at the end of the
    Third Act, are entirely of British manufacture. We understand
    that they are from the looms of Messrs. PUFF AND RECLAME.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In the First Act of the same piece, it will be remembered
    that the bridal party is captured whole by <i>Hubando</i>,
    disguised as a mendicant, in the recesses of one of the forests
    of the Abruzzi. The real pine-trees, which are to figure in the
    foreground of this striking scene, have been grown, with
    immense labour and expense, in the well-known nurseries of
    Messrs. WEEDEM AND POTTER, at Ditchington. The mendicant's
    rags, it should be added, are from one of our most celebrated
    slop-shops in the Ratcliff Highway.</p>

    much impressed by the idea of Clerical Assurance, and expressed

    of the Directors. "But what puzzles me," observed the excellent

    thought that had been disposed of. Or," she added, brightening

    <p>"I once did manage to make a cast correctly," writes ANDREW
    LANG, in his charming book anent the sport and pastime of
    fishing, and if ever HENRY IRVING made a cast to catch the
    public, it is now, when he uses as his bait SHAKSPEARE's
    <i>Henry the Eighth</i>, got up in a style which emphatically
    "beats the record," so utterly "regardless of expense" is it,
    with well-tried, responsible actors, in what may be called
    minor parts, though the majority of the <i>dramatis personæ</i>
    are on a fair dramatic equality, and with Our ELLEN TERRY, as
    <i>Queen Katharine</i>, and himself as the great Lord
    Cardinal.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">

             alt="'Go to,' Norfolk and Suffolk!" /></a>"Go to,"
             Norfolk and Suffolk!
    </div>

    <p>The first difficulty that HENRY IRVING had to
    face&mdash;literally to face&mdash;was that by no sort of art
    could he make up his features to be an exact portrait of
    CARDINAL WOLSEY. Personally, I prefer Mr. IRVING's picture of
    WOLSEY to the extant portraits, which concur in representing
    him as a heavy, jowly-faced man, who might be taken as a model
    for one of GUSTAVE DORÉ'S eccentric-looking ecclesiastics in
    the <i>Contes Drolatiques</i>, rather than as the living
    presentment of the great Chancellor, Statesman, and Churchman
    who ruled a cruel, crafty, sensual tyrant, and successfully
    guided the policy of England at home and abroad. HENRY IRVING's
    <i>Cardinal</i> is a grand figure, courtly, though somewhat too
    cringing withal, evidently despising the various means he uses
    to further the end he has in view, and looking upon the Lords,
    Courtiers and all around him as merely puppets, whose strings
    he holds to work them as he will.</p>

    <p>Then, after seeing him as Sole Adviser of the Crown, after
    seeing him as Highest Judge in the Ecclesiastical Divorce Court
    in such splendid state as our Judge JEUNE may eye with envy,
    after seeing him in his own Palace, most courteous as Grand
    Master and liberal Provider of Right Royal Revels, he is
    exhibited to us in the deserted Hall, a spectacle for gods and
    men (that is, shown to the Gallery and the rest of the
    audience), the single figure of the Great Cardinal, fallen from
    his high estate; and to him, in place of all his princely
    retinue, comes his one faithful servant, CROMWELL, supporting
    his dying master, for dying he is, as he staggers feebly from
    the Palace at Bridewell. It is difficult to call to mind any
    situation in any play more genuinely affecting in its
    simplicity than this. The audience is held
    spell-bound,&mdash;yet, for my part, I should have welcomed a
    greater variety in tone and action.</p>

    <p>Miss ELLEN TERRY's <i>Queen Katharine</i> is a "very woman."
    You can see how she has caught the King, and how she still
    holds him. She loves him, actually loves him, to the last to
    respect him is impossible, but she respects herself; and it is
    just this love for him, for what he was, not what he is, and
    her respect for herself, which Miss ELLEN TERRY marks so
    forcibly. <i>Katharine</i> is a foreigner, therefore is her
    bearing, though stately, less stolid than that of the typical
    English Tragedy Queen. The note of her dying scene, so striking
    by its simplicity, is its perfect tranquillity. Who's
    <i>Griffith</i>? Why the veteran HOWE (ah, Howe, When and Where
    did I first see you, Sir? Wasn't it in the days when good old
    Mortonian farces were the attraction at the Haymarket?) is
    "<i>the</i> safe man," and excellently well did he deliver his
    epitaph on <i>Wolsey</i>. But all are good, not forgetting our
    old friend the sterling, that is the ARTHUR STIRLING actor as
    <i>Cranmer</i>, and the youthful GILLIE FARQUHAR,
    unrecognisable as <i>Lord Sands</i>, looking as ancient as if
    he were The Sands of Time.</p>

    <h2>CONFESSIONS OF A DUFFER.</h2>

    <h3>I.&mdash;GOLF.</h3>

    <p>The Fairies who came to my Christening provided me with a
    large collection of toys, implements, and other articles. There
    was a heart, a tender one, a pen of gold, a set of Golf-clubs,
    a bat, wickets, and a ball, oars and a boat, boxing gloves,
    foils, guns, rifles, books, everything, except ready money,
    that heart could desire. Unluckily one Fairy, who was old,
    deaf, plain, and who had not been invited, observed, "It is all
    very well, my child, but not one of these articles shall you be
    able to use satisfactorily." This awful curse has hung heavy on
    my doom. With a restless desire to shine and excel, at Lord's,
    on the river, on the Moors, in the forests, in Society, on the
    Links, bitter personal experience and the remarks of candid
    friends, tell me that the doom has come upon me. I am "an
    all-round Duffer," as my youngest nephew, <i>ætat.</i> XI.,
    freely informed me, when I served twice out of court (once into
    the conservatory, the other time through the study window). I
    was a Duffer at marbles, also at tops, and my personal efforts
    in these kinds were constantly in liquidation. But what are
    marbles and tops! The first regular game I was entered at was
    Golf. Five is not too early to begin, and I began at five by
    being knocked down with a club which another small boy was
    brandishing. This naturally gave me an extreme zeal for the
    sport of MARY STUART, the Great Marquis of MONTROSE, CHARLES
    EDWARD (who introduced Golf into Italy), DUNCAN FORBES of
    Culloden, Mr. HORACE HUTCHINSON, and other eminent historical
    characters.</p>

    <div class="figright"

        <a href="images/35.png"><img width="100%"

    </div>

    <p>Almost everybody now knows that Golf is not Hockey. Nobody
    <i>runs</i> after the ball except young ladies at
    W&mdash;m&mdash;n! The object is to put a very small ball into
    a very tiny and remotely distant hole, with engines singularly
    ill adapted for the purpose. There are many engines. First
    there is the Driver, a long club, wherewith the ball is
    supposed to be propelled from the tee, a little patch of sand.
    The Tee and the Caddie have nothing to do with each other;
    nobody but a flippant Cockney sees any fun in plays upon words
    which, in themselves, are only too serious. Then there is a
    weapon called a Brassey. It is like unto a club, but is shod
    with brass, and is used for hitting a ball in "a bad lie" among
    long grass or heather. A small tomahawk, styled a Cleek, is
    employed when you don't know what else to play with. The same
    remark applies to an Iron, which is very good for missing the
    ball with, also for hitting to square leg when you meant to go
    straight. A "Mashy" is a smaller "iron." The skilful use these
    when the ball lies in sand, in gorse, or when they wish to make
    the ball soar for a short distance and then fall dead. A Putter
    is a short thickish club used for jogging the ball into the
    hole with. There are plenty of other kinds of clubs, also
    spoons, but <i>these</i> are enough to break the heart of any
    Duffer.</p>

    <p>I am an old player, of forty years' standing, but, like
    <i>Parolles</i> I was "made for every man to breathe himself
    on." When my form is espied near the links, the players shirk
    off as if I were a leper. They are afraid I may want to make a
    match with them, and there is no falsehood from which they will
    shrink, in their desire to escape me. Even Ladies,&mdash;but
    this is a delicate theme. Beginners breathe themselves on me,
    and give me odds after two or three engagements.</p>

    <p>Yet I don't know why I am so bad. True, I am short-sighted,
    never see the flag at the hole, play in the wrong direction,
    and talk a good deal on topics of academic interest during the
    round. The Golfer's mind should be a blank, and generally is
    "blank enough," like <i>Sir Tor's</i> shield. My mind is,
    perhaps, too active&mdash;that may be what is the matter with
    me. It is the same thing at whist&mdash;but of this hereafter.
    My Caddie, or arm-bearer, has his own views about the causes of
    my incompetence.</p>

    <p>"Ye're no standing richt. Ye haud yer hands wrang. Ye tak'
    yer ee off the ba'. Ye're ower quick up. Ye're ower slow doun.
    Ye dinna swing. Ye fa' back. Ye haud ower ticht wi' yer richt
    hand. Ye dinna let your arms gang easy. Ye whiles tap, and
    whiles slice, and whiles heel, or ye hit her aff the tae. Ye're
    hooking her. Ye're no thinking o' what ye're doing. Ye'll never
    be a Gowfer. Lord! ony man can lairn Greek, but Gowf needs a
    heid."</p>

    <p>Here are fifteen ways of going wrong, and there is only one
    way of going right! Fifteen things to think of, every time you
    take a driver in hand. And, remember, that is not nearly all.
    These fifteen fatal errors apply to long driving. You may (or
    at least <i>I</i> may, and do) make plenty of other blunders
    with the other weapons. Say the ball lies in sand&mdash;"a
    bunker," technically. If you hit it whack on the top, it
    disappears in a foot-mark. If you "tak' plenty o' sand," why,
    you <i>get</i> plenty of sand in your mouth, your eyes, down
    the back of your neck, and the ball is no forwarder. If you
    strike her quite clean, she goes like a bullet against the face
    of the bunker, soars in the air, falls on your head, and you
    lose the hole! Oh, Golf is full of bitterness!</p>

    <p>Suppose we play a round. The ball is neatly "tee'd" on a
    patch of sand. I approach, I shuffle with my feet for a secure
    footing, I waggle my club in an airy manner. Then I take it up
    and whack it down. A variety of things <i>may</i> occur. I may
    smite the top of the hall, when it runs on for twenty yards and
    lies in a rut on the road. I may hit her on the heel of the
    club, when she spins, with much "cut" on, into the sea. I may
    hit her with the toe of the club, when she soars to square leg,
    and perhaps breaks a window. I used to try running in at the
    ball, as if it were a half-volley at Cricket, but that way lies
    madness. However, suppose that, in a lucid interval (as will
    happen), I hit her clean. She soars away, and falls within
    forty yards of a meandering burn. The hole, the haven where one
    would be, is beyond the burn.</p>

    <p>I seize a cleek or an iron, it turns in my hand, cuts up the
    turf, and the ball rolls half a dozen feet. My opponent has
    crossed the burn. I try again; a fearful misdirected shot; the
    ball soars over the burn and lands in a road behind the hole.
    There is no hitting out of this road, or, if one does hit a
    desperate blow, the ball lands in an eccentric sand-hole,
    called the Scholar's Bunker. We start for the next hole.
    <i>Même jeu!</i> Now we are in the gorse, now among the Station
    Master's potatoes, now in the railway, where all hope may be
    abandoned, now in bunkers many, now missing the ball
    altogether, when you feel as if your arms had flown off. As for
    "putting" the short strokes on the green, near the hole, if I
    hit sharp, the ball runs over the hole yards and yards beyond,
    or if I hit mild, it stops with an air of plaintive
    resignation, after dribbling for a foot or two. And the worst
    of it is that, sometimes, you will play as well as another for
    half-a-dozen holes. Then one thinks one has The Secret! But it
    falls from us, vanishes, we are topping and slicing, and
    heeling, and missing again as sorrily as ever.</p>

    <p>The beauty of Golf is that there are so many ways of going
    wrong, and so many things to think of. A person of very
    moderately active mind has his ideas diverted by the landscape,
    the sea, the blossom on the gorse, the larks singing overhead,
    not to mention the whole system of the universe. He forgets to
    keep his eye on the ball, in devoting his energy to holding
    tight with his left, and being slow up. Or he remembers to keep
    his eye on the ball, and forgets the other essentials. Then an
    awful moment comes when he loses his temper. Thereby all is
    lost, honour (not to mention "the honour,") and everything.
    People in front, old people, are so provoking. They potter
    tardily along, pass ten minutes in considering a putt, shout
    and swear if you hit into them, and are not pleased if you sit
    down and smoke while you wait. The only entity that I don't
    lose my temper with is my partner. The worse he plays, the
    better am I pleased to have a brother in adversity. The
    subjective Golfer, however, is certainly a bore. He is "put
    off" by every simple circumstance, by his opponent wearing an
    unbecoming cap and the like. Afterwards, he will hold forth for
    hours on all his sorrows and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
       id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> all the sins of others. The
       Duffer is more modest and less apologetic. He is kept always
       playing (as I said) by the diabolical circumstance that he
       has lucid intervals, though rarely, when he plays like other
       people for three or four holes. I once, myself did the long
       hole in&mdash;but never mind. Nobody would believe me. The
       most amiable of Duffers was he who, after ten strokes in a
       bunker, cut his ball into three parts. "I am bringing it
       out," he said, "in penny numbers."</p>

    <p>The born Duffer, I speak feelingly, is incurable. No amount
    of odds will put him on the level even of Scotch Professors.
    For the learned have divided Golf into several categories.
    There is Professional Golf, the best Amateur Golf, Enthusiasts'
    Golf, Golf, Beginners' Golf, Ladies' Golf, Infant Golf, Parlour
    Golf, the Golf of Scotch Professors. But the true Duffer's Golf
    is far, far below that. A Duffer like me is too bad for
    hanging. He should be condemned to play for life at Chorley
    Wood, or to bush-whack at Bungay.</p>

    <p>FREE AND EASY THEATRES.&mdash;We have no sympathy whatever
    with the idea of a Théâtre Libre or with a Free-and-Easy
    Theatre, but we shall be very glad when all Theatres are made
    Easy, Easy, that is, as to sitting accommodation, and Easy of
    egress and ingress. But if the space is to be enlarged, will
    not the prices have to be enlarged too? 'Tis a problem in the
    discussion of which <i>The Players</i>, which is a new journal,
    solely devoted to things Dramatic and Theatrical, would find
    congenial employment.</p>

    <p>After copious draughts of novels and romances which, the
    morning after, leave the literary palate as dry as a lime-kiln,
    or as Mrs. RAM would say, "as a lamb-kin," the Baron, thirsting
    for a more satisfying beverage, took up a volume, which he may
    fairly describe as a youthful quarto, or an imperial pinto,
    coming from the CHAPMAN AND HALL cellars, that is,
    book-sellers, entitled <i>On Shibboleths</i>, and written by
    W.S. LILLY. In a recent trial it came out that Mr. GEORGE
    MEREDITH is the accredited and professional reader for Messrs.
    CHAPMAN AND HALL. Is it possible that this eminent
    philosophical Novelist is indebted to a quiet perusal of
    <i>Shibboleths</i> for some of the quaint philosophical touches
    not to be read off schoolboywise, with hurried ellipses,
    blurting lips, and unintelligent brain, if any, which make
    <i>One of Our Conquerors</i> and others, worth perusal? Be this
    as it may, which is a convenient shibbolethian formula, the
    Baron read this book, and enjoyed it muchly. There is an
    occasional dig into the Huxleian anatomy, given with all the
    politeness of a Louis-the-Fifteenthian "M.A.," otherwise
    <i>Maître d'Armes</i>, and a passing reference to "The People's
    WILLIAM" and the carrying out of the People's will&mdash;which
    is quite another affair,&mdash;all, to quote Sir PETER, "vastly
    entertaining." The chapter on the Shibboleth "Education" is,
    thinks the Baron, about the best. Mr. LILLY is a Satirist who,
    as GEORGIUS MEREDITHIUS MAGNUS might express it, is, in his
    fervour, near a truth, grasps it, and is moved to moral
    distinctness, mental intention, with a preference of strong,
    plain speech, and a chuck of interjectory quotation over the
    crack of his whip, with which tramping active he flicks his
    fellows sharply. With which Meredithism concludes</p>

    <h2>PREUX CHEVALIER.</h2>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;The amazing popularity of the Costermonger Songs
    seems to me a significant phenomenon. While no humane person
    would deny to the itinerant vendor of comestibles that sympathy
    which is accorded to the joys and sorrows of his more refined
    fellow-creatures, it is impossible to view without alarm the
    hold which his loose and ungrammatical diction is obtaining in
    the most cultured <i>salons</i> of to-day. Anxious to minimise
    the danger, yet loth to check a sentiment of fraternity so
    creditable to our common humanity, I have devised a plan by
    which Mr. CHEVALIER's songs may he rendered in such-wise that
    while all their deep humanity is preserved, their English is so
    elevated as to be innocuous to the nicest sensibility. Permit
    me to give, just as a sample, my treatment of that very popular
    ballad, known, <i>rubesco referens</i>, as "<i>Knocked 'em in
    the Old Kent Road</i>." Not being a singer, I have adopted Mr.
    CLIFFORD HARRISON's charming plan of speaking through the music
    of the song, and this is how <i>I</i> render the
    chorus:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"'How is it with you?' was the universal exclamation of the
    residents in the vicinity.</p>

    <p>"'With whom, WILLIAM, have you made an appointment?'</p>

    <p>"'Have you, WILLIAM, purchased all the house-property in
    this thoroughfare?'</p>

    <p>"Were my risible faculties exercised?&mdash;you ask me. Nay.
    Indeed I was actually apprehensive of a fatal issue.</p>

    <p>"So striking was the effect produced upon those in the
    ancient Cantian highway."</p>

    <p>This, Sir, not only gives the sense, but gives it, I venture
    to claim, in a form fit for the apprehension of the most
    refined. Judging, too, by the reception it met with at our
    recent Penny Readings, I am convinced that Mr. CHEVALIER's
    peculiar humour is thoroughly preserved, for, indeed, many of
    the audience laughed till I became positively concerned for
    their safety.</p>

    <p>That fiendish malefactor, the Influenza Bacillus, has been

    said to be his "immobility." Ugh! the hard-hearted

    short-breathings, sighs, no groans, no sufferings, nothing will
    move him. There he remains, untouched, immobile. But there was
    one hopeful sign mentioned in the <i>Times</i> of last
    Saturday&mdash;the Bacillus was found "in chains, and in
    strings." Let the chains be the heaviest possible till he can
    be tried by a Judge and Jury; and don't resort to "strings"

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
